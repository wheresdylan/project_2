# Team 2 Proposal: Shot Spot

## 1.Roles:

Nanette and Mandie = Front-End
Carla, Sean, Dylan = Back-End
All = Everything!  

## What are we doing:  

1. The user finds a bar based on 3 categories: cheap drinks, unique drinks, great happy hour. 
2. The user chooses the bar based on the location results, via which of the 3 category was chosen. 
3. Once the user is at the bar, they can optionally check in with a name or username, and then input feedback (in real time, kind of like yelp). 

## 2.  Elevator Pitch:

“We are creating Shot Spot, an ideal way for weekend warriors to find a watering hole based on 3 categories: cheap drinks, unique drinks, and great happy hours.  The user chooses their location based on their chosen category.  Then once at the location can, in real-time, check in and make a comment.  The check-in and comment is a way for new users to get an idea of what they may experience and can make a more informed decision on where to go”

## 3. Who is this for?  What Problem do they have?  What problem does this solve?:

This app is for thirsty people looking for a place to consume a cheap drink, a unique drink or go to a great happy hour.  The problem that thirsty people often have is that they are upset they wasted money on an improperly or poorly mixed drink.  Shot spot solves this problem by giving real time information to users, so they can make a more informed decision.

# Project Starter

In this activity we will add the provided boilerplate to group project repos.

## Instructions

* Only one member of each group should complete this activity while the others watch.

* Copy the entire [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder to another location on your computers &mdash; wherever you would like your local copy of the group project to be.

* Rename the copied "Unsolved" folder to the name of your project.

* Open the copied project folder's `package.json` file and change its `name` property to the name of your project.

* CD to the root of the copied project folder with your terminal and run the following commands:

  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

* Then copy the GitHub repo's remote SSH URL (the same URL you'd use to clone the repo).

* Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing <remote-url> with your GitHub repo's remote SSH URL.

  ```
  git remote add origin <remote-url>
  git push origin master
  ```

* If completed successfully you should see all of the files uploaded to GitHub.

* All other group members should now clone the repo.

* Discuss as a group:

  * How would you now add changes to this project?
